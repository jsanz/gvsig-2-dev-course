Curso desarrollo gvSIG - d√≠a 1
============================================


# Lesson 1

- Reviewed docs, nothing to note is a general introduction to the gvSIG architecture.


# Lesson 2

- I start reading the lesson 2
- Change encoding of the workspace to ISO-8851
- I install gvSIG 2.0 dev version (build 2048)
- I have to change to metacity in order to be able to see the _Create Plugin_ interface
- I can progress normally with the rest of the lesson to set up Eclipse and review the initial layout of components

## Notes 

- I had to add an _export_ to the last line of the `.gvisg.platform.properties`
- I had to execute `metacity --replace` to remove compiz so I can see the _Create Plugin_ GUI
- The links on the documents refer to _https_ links on gvSIG portal. They should link to the http version
- Is needed the official gvSIG header for this course? Is a good point for official developments but for a
  general development is not needed.
- On the _External tools_ favorite section `mvn create_installer` is recommended but afterwards it doesn't appear
  at the screenshot
